# sequelizedBurger
Remove all references to my vanilla MySQL queries and replace them with Sequelize queries.

Replacing my MySQL `Burger` model with a Sequelized equivalent. edited the model and initial migration file to make the burger's devoured field carry a default value of false -- otherwise you might encounter bugs.
    * synced the models!
